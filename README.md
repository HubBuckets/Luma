## Installation

### How to install library Chroma


Install with the "Add Library..." tool

New for Processing 2.0: Add contributed libraries by selecting "Add Library..."
from the "Import Library..." submenu within the Sketch menu. Not all available
libraries have been converted to show up in this menu. If a library isn't there,
it will need to be installed manually by following the instructions below.


### Manual Install

Contributed libraries may be downloaded separately and manually placed within
the "libraries" folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find (and change) the
Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window
from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook location"
item at the top.

Copy the contributed library's folder into the "libraries" folder at this
location. You will need to create the "libraries" folder if this is your first
contributed library.

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder:
For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `~/Documents/Processing`.
For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is located inside
`My Documents/Processing`.

The folder structure for library Chroma should be as follows:

```
Processing
    libraries
        Chroma
              examples
              library
                    Chroma.jar
              reference
              src
```

Some folders like "examples" or "src" might be missing. After library
Chroma has been successfully installed, restart the Processing
application.
